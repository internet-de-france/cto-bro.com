How it works:
  Text: "## CTO Bro in practice"
  Body:
  - "### 100% live chat\n\nThe \"one to one\" chat experience is our way to address
    the challenges of our customers, we use it to get to know them and share years
    of experience.\n\nWritten communication is a common practice among today's devs
    and CTOs, in open source communities, in remote companies and in general in the
    technical departments of modern companies. This has many advantages:\n\n*![Structured
    mentoring](uploads/2640826-512-e24cb2.png)\n\nMore structured discussions with
    more reflection between exchanges, with the possibility of transmitting links
    or commenting on a particular document or sentence *![Reporting for coaching sessions](uploads/2438288-512.png)\nA
    traceability of the exchanges, search of information in the history, possible
    monitoring of the activity to detect a possible dysfunction and follow-up of the
    invoicing *![Asynchronous mentoring](uploads/2951044-512.png)\nMore asynchronous
    communication, even if it's a live chat, you can answer an IRL question or another
    channel without having to put the meeting on hold *![CTO mentoring coaching](uploads/2068825-512.png)\n\nMore
    serene discussions without the \"noise\" related to the environment - noise in
    the open space but also bad connections, computer rowing ... "

    ### How it works ? We set objectives together and, depending on the needs, here's what we do concretely:
    * Codes reviews on "pull requests" * Architectural meetings and technical choices * Regular points on the recruitment strategy * Innovation consulting, prototyping, MVP, road map

    Development of web apps, B2B and B2C platforms, APIs * UI/UX, product management,
