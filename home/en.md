How it works:
  Text: "## CTO Bro in practice"
  Body:
  - "### 100% live chat\n\nThe **\"one to one\" chat experience** is our way to address
    the challenges of our customers, we use it to get to know them and share years
    of experience.\n\nWritten communication is a **common practice among today's devs
    and CTOs**, in **open source communities**, in **remote companies** and in general
    in the technical teams of modern companies. This has many advantages:\n\n* ![Structured
    mentoring](uploads/2640826-512-e24cb2.png)\n\n  More **structured discussions**
    with thinking between exchanges, with the possibility of **linking** and **commenting**
    on a particular document or sentence\n* ![Reporting for coaching sessions](uploads/2438288-512.png)\n\n
    \ A **traceability** of the exchanges, **search** of information in the history,
    **monitoring** of the activity to detect a possible dysfunction and estimate the
    time spent\n* ![Asynchronous mentoring](uploads/2951044-512.png)\n\n  More **asynchronous
    communication**, even if it's a live chat, you can answer an IRL question or another
    channel without having to put the meeting on hold\n\n* ![CTO mentoring coaching](uploads/2068825-512.png)\n\n
    \ More **serene discussions** without the \"noise\" related to the environment
    - noise in the open space but also due to bad connections, slow computer... \n"
  - "### How it works ? \n\nWe set **objectives** together and, depending on the needs,
    here's what we can do:\n\n* Codes reviews on \"pull requests\"\n* Architectural
    meetings and technical discussions \n* Regular meetings on the recruitment strategy\n*
    Consulting for innovation, prototyping, MVP, road map\n"
