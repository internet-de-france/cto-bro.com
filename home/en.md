How it works:
  Text: "## CTO Bro in practice"
  Body:
  - "### 100% live chat\nThe \"one to one\" chat experience allows us to address the
    issues of our customers, to get to know them to share their years of experience.\n\nThe
    use of writing is a common practice among today's devs and CTOs, in open source
    communities, in remote companies and in general in the technical departments of
    modern companies. This has many advantages:\n*![Structured mentoring](uploads/2640826-512-e24cb2.png)\n\nMore
    structured discussions with more reflection between exchanges, with the possibility
    of transmitting links or commenting on a particular document or sentence *![Reporting
    for coaching sessions](uploads/2438288-512.png)\nA traceability of the exchanges,
    search of information in the history, possible monitoring of the activity to detect
    a possible dysfunction and follow-up of the invoicing *![Asynchronous mentoring](uploads/2951044-512.png)\nMore
    asynchronous communication, even if it's a live chat, you can answer an IRL question
    or another channel without having to put the meeting on hold *![CTO mentoring
    coaching](uploads/2068825-512.png)\n\nMore serene discussions without the \"noise\"
    related to the environment - noise in the open space but also bad connections,
    computer rowing ... "

    ![alex hoyau cto](uploads/alex.jpg) ## Alex Hoyau 8 years of XP as CTO
    In the last 17 years I have been a CTO for 6 years and a freelance/entrepreneur for 8 years.
    I am an experienced manager and a senior full stack developer. I developed my leadership in startup environments as well as in open source communities. On a more personal level, I am a volunteer in the Silex Labs association that I founded in 2010 to bring diversity to tech companies.
    I have significant experience in consulting, architecture, planning and development of critical projects for companies and startups.

    ![Xavier Hausherr CTO](uploads/xavier.jpg) ## Xavier Hausherr 3 x CTO
    Since 2010 I lead the technical teams of companies for whom rapid growth is vital. In my last 3 experiences I have managed more than 50 developers, hired dozens of people. Together, we have evolved platforms delivering content to hundreds of millions of users every month.
    Developer first and foremost, I learned everything by myself and I stay on top of technology. I like to do code reviews as much as job interviews, set up the IC as much as the recruitment strategy or plan a road map. And above all, I like to share and progress with my colleagues.

    Key skills: code review, architecture, dev ops and CI, recruitment, HR, management.
