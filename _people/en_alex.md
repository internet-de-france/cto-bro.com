### Alex Hoyau
#### 8 years as a CTO

In the past 17 years I have been a CTO for 6 years and a freelancer/entrepreneur for 8 years. 

I am an experienced leader and a senior full stack developer. I have initially developed my leadership abilities in startup environments as well as in open source communities. At a more personal level, I volunteer to bring diversity to tech companies with the foundation I created in 2010, [Silex Labs](https://www.silexlabs.org/).

I have significant experience in consulting, architecture, planning and development on critical projects for corporations and startups. 

Skills: code review, architecture, CI and industrial workflows, recruitment, leadership
