### Fred Parisis

Hello there, I'm FP. I was previously at Causes, founded AbcdeFg, released Hijk, Lmnop, and Qrstuv.

I'm a Senior Software Engineer, a photographer, and I love traveling. I'm always busy on various projects, usually using iOS and Ruby on Rails with Growth Hacking in mind. 

I enjoy being busy, started working professionally in 1998, and never stopped since. I convert others to Pivotal Tracker and Agile methods.
