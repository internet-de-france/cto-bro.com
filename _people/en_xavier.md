### Xavier Hausherr
#### 3 x CTO

Since 2010 I lead the technical teams of companies for whom rapid growth is vital. In my last 3 experiences I managed more than 50 developers, hired dozens of people. Together, we have made platforms evolved while delivering content to hundreds of millions of users every month.

As a self taught developer I keep learning and I stay on top of technology. I like to do code reviews as much as job interviews, set up a CI workflow as much as a recruitment strategy or plan a road map. And above all, I like to share and grow with my colleagues.

Skills: code review, architecture, dev ops and CI, recruitment, HR, management.
